The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is the third of the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. It was introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987 and states:

    "Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program."

In simpler terms, it means that subclasses should be able to stand in for their parent class without breaking the application. Any instance of a subclass should behave in the same way as an instance of the superclass, following the same contracts and expectations.

# Why LSP Matters

    Substitutability: It ensures that derived classes can be used in place of their base classes, preserving the integrity of the application.
    Correct Behavior: Subclasses should not alter the fundamental behavior of the base class in ways that violate the expectations set by the base class.
    Maintainability: Following LSP keeps systems easier to maintain because you can confidently substitute derived classes without the fear of breaking the system.

# LSP in Java: Detailed Explanation

## The Liskov Substitution Principle is violated when subclasses:

- Override behavior in a way that violates the expectations of the base class.
- Restrict functionality that is available in the base class.
- Throw unexpected exceptions or fail in scenarios where the base class would succeed.

Letâ€™s break this down with examples.

### Example Scenario: Rectangle and Square

A classic example that violates LSP is the relationship between Rectangle and Square. A Square is mathematically a specialized form of a Rectangle, so it seems logical to make Square inherit from Rectangle. However, this can lead to issues violating LSP.

### Without LSP (Violation Example)

```java
class Rectangle {
    protected int width;
    protected int height;

    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
    }

    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.height = height;
    }

    public int getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {

    @Override
    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = width;  // Force height to equal width
    }

    @Override
    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = height;  // Force width to equal height
    }
}
```
In this example, Square inherits from Rectangle, but it violates LSP. The Square class changes the behavior of setWidth() and setHeight() to ensure that the width and height are always equal. This breaks the expectations of the Rectangle class, which allows independent width and height.

### Why This Violates LSP

```java
public class LSPTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle();
        rectangle.setWidth(5);
        rectangle.setHeight(10);
        System.out.println("Rectangle area: " + rectangle.getArea());  // Expected output: 50

        Rectangle square = new Square();  // LSP violation
        square.setWidth(5);
        square.setHeight(10);
        System.out.println("Square area: " + square.getArea());  // Unexpected output: 100
    }
}
```
In this code, even though a Square is used in place of a Rectangle, the results are unexpected. A rectangle with width 5 and height 10 should have an area of 50, but the Square gives an incorrect result (100) because of the overridden behavior.

This violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because the Square is not behaving in a way that is consistent with a Rectangle.

### Fixing the Violation: Refactor Design

To adhere to LSP, we need to ensure that Square and Rectangle are treated as separate entities because their behavior is fundamentally different.

#### Applying LSP: Separate the Square and Rectangle

```java
abstract class Shape {
    public abstract int getArea();
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    protected int width;
    protected int height;

    public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
    }

    public void setHeight(int height) {
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public int getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    private int side;

    public Square(int side) {
        this.side = side;
    }

    public void setSide(int side) {
        this.side = side;
    }

    @Override
    public int getArea() {
        return side * side;
    }
}
```
### Usage Example

```java
public class LSPTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 10);
        System.out.println("Rectangle area: " + rectangle.getArea());  // Output: 50

        Shape square = new Square(5);
        System.out.println("Square area: " + square.getArea());  // Output: 25
    }
}
```
Now, Rectangle and Square are treated as separate shapes, and the behavior is consistent. A Rectangle behaves as expected, and a Square follows its own rules without conflicting with the logic of a rectangle. This design follows the Liskov Substitution Principle because both Rectangle and Square can be substituted for the abstract Shape class without introducing any unexpected behavior.

## Another Example: LSP in Service Classes

Imagine you have a service class that retrieves data from a repository. A subclass should not alter the expectations of how this service works.

### Without LSP (Violation)

```java
class UserRepository {
    public User findUserById(int id) {
        // Finds and returns user by id
        return new User(id, "John Doe");
    }
}

class CachedUserRepository extends UserRepository {

    @Override
    public User findUserById(int id) {
        // Breaks the contract by throwing an exception if not cached
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Caching not yet implemented");
    }
}
```
The CachedUserRepository violates LSP because it changes the behavior of findUserById() by throwing an exception instead of retrieving a user. This breaks the expectations set by the base class (UserRepository).

### Applying LSP: Fixing the Design

```java
class UserRepository {
    public User findUserById(int id) {
        // Finds and returns user by id
        return new User(id, "John Doe");
    }
}

class CachedUserRepository extends UserRepository {

    private Map<Integer, User> cache = new HashMap<>();

    @Override
    public User findUserById(int id) {
        if (cache.containsKey(id)) {
            return cache.get(id);
        }
        User user = super.findUserById(id);
        cache.put(id, user);  // Cache the result for future calls
        return user;
    }
}
```
In this case, the CachedUserRepository still extends UserRepository but adheres to LSP by keeping the original contract. It either retrieves the user from the cache or falls back to the base class implementation to retrieve it from the repository.

### Key Takeaways for LSP:

- Subclasses should extend the functionality of their base classes without altering their behavior in unexpected ways.
- Subclasses should not throw new exceptions, remove existing functionality, or violate the expectations set by the base class.
- LSP is key to ensuring substitutability in your code, promoting reusability and flexibility without breaking the system.

By following the Liskov Substitution Principle, you ensure that your Java classes are interchangeable without introducing bugs or inconsistencies.
