The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. It states that:

    "A class should have only one reason to change."

In other words, a class should only have one job or responsibility. If a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes harder to maintain, understand, and extend because any change in one responsibility may affect the others.
Why SRP Matters

- **Maintainability**: A class with only one responsibility is easier to maintain. If the responsibility changes, you only need to modify that specific class without affecting unrelated functionality.
- **Testability**: A class with one responsibility is easier to test since it has a single focus.
- **Decoupling**: SRP leads to loosely coupled systems where different classes handle different concerns, making it easier to change or replace parts of the system.

# SRP in Java: Detailed Example

Let’s consider an example of a system that manages user profiles. A violation of the SRP would be a class that handles multiple responsibilities, like storing user data, validating input, and printing reports.
Without SRP (Violation of SRP)

```java
public class UserProfile {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    public UserProfile(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    // Responsibility 1: Handling user data
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }

    // Responsibility 2: Validating email
    public boolean isValidEmail() {
        return email.contains("@");
    }

    // Responsibility 3: Printing user data
    public void printUserDetails() {
        System.out.println("User: " + name);
        System.out.println("Email: " + email);
    }
}
```

In the above example, the UserProfile class has multiple responsibilities:

- Managing user data (e.g., getName(), setName(), getEmail(), setEmail()).
- Validating email (isValidEmail()).
- Printing user details (printUserDetails()).

This violates the Single Responsibility Principle, as changes to any of these responsibilities might affect the other parts of the class. For example, if you change the logic for email validation, you risk breaking the user management or printing logic.
Applying SRP (Separate Classes for Each Responsibility)

Now let’s refactor the class to follow the SRP by separating each responsibility into its own class.

## 1. Class for User Data

```java
public class UserProfile {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    public UserProfile(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    // Handling user data responsibility
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }
}
```

Now, this class is only responsible for managing user data. It no longer handles email validation or printing user details.

## 2. Class for Email Validation

```java
public class EmailValidator {

    // Responsibility: Validating email
    public boolean isValid(String email) {
        return email.contains("@");
    }
}
```

We’ve created a separate EmailValidator class that is responsible for email validation. This way, if we need to change the validation logic, we only modify this class without affecting the user profile management.

## 3. Class for Printing User Data

```java
public class UserPrinter {

    // Responsibility: Printing user details
    public void printUserDetails(UserProfile user) {
        System.out.println("User: " + user.getName());
        System.out.println("Email: " + user.getEmail());
    }
}
```

The UserPrinter class is now responsible for printing user details. If the printing logic changes (e.g., switching to JSON or logging to a file), you only modify this class.

### Usage

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UserProfile user = new UserProfile("John Doe", "john@example.com");

        // Email validation
        EmailValidator validator = new EmailValidator();
        if (validator.isValid(user.getEmail())) {
            System.out.println("Valid email");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid email");
        }

        // Printing user details
        UserPrinter printer = new UserPrinter();
        printer.printUserDetails(user);
    }
}
```

### Benefits of SRP in this Example

- **Ease of Change**: If the email validation logic changes, you only update the EmailValidator class without touching UserProfile or UserPrinter.
- **Reusability**: The EmailValidator and UserPrinter can be reused in other parts of the system if needed, without dragging unnecessary responsibilities.
- **Testability**: You can write unit tests for each class in isolation (e.g., testing only email validation, user management, or printing logic separately).

# Summary

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ensures that a class or module has only one reason to change by focusing on a single task or responsibility. By separating concerns, your Java code becomes easier to maintain, extend, and test, as seen in the refactored example
