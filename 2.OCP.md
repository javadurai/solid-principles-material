The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the key principles in object-oriented programming (OOP) and is part of the SOLID design principles. It was introduced by Bertrand Meyer and states:

    "Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification."

In simpler terms, this means that:

- **Open for extension**: You should be able to add new functionality to a class or module without altering its existing code.
- **Closed for modification**: The existing code of the class or module should not change when new behavior is added, thus reducing the risk of introducing new bugs.

The Open/Closed Principle helps in designing software systems that are more flexible and maintainable by allowing you to add new features without altering the existing, tested, and working code.

# Why OCP Matters

- **Reduce Risk**: Modifying existing code can introduce bugs. OCP encourages adding new functionality without changing the existing logic.
- **Maintainability**: Since classes are not modified, they remain stable, and you can confidently extend them with new features.
- **Extensibility**: You can extend or customize functionality without changing the original behavior, making the system easier to scale.

# OCP in Java: Detailed Example

Let’s explore an example to see the Open/Closed Principle in action.
Scenario: Shape Area Calculator

Imagine a simple application that calculates the area of different shapes: Rectangle, Circle, etc. A bad approach that violates OCP would be calculating all areas within a single class and modifying it each time you add a new shape.

## Without OCP (Violation of OCP)

```java
public class AreaCalculator {

    // Calculate the total area of all shapes
    public double calculateTotalArea(List<Object> shapes) {
        double totalArea = 0;

        for (Object shape : shapes) {
            if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
                Rectangle rectangle = (Rectangle) shape;
                totalArea += rectangle.getWidth() * rectangle.getHeight();
            } else if (shape instanceof Circle) {
                Circle circle = (Circle) shape;
                totalArea += Math.PI * circle.getRadius() * circle.getRadius();
            }
            // If a new shape, e.g., Triangle, is introduced, this class must be modified
        }

        return totalArea;
    }
}

class Rectangle {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    public double getHeight() {
        return height;
    }
}

class Circle {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public double getRadius() {
        return radius;
    }
}
```

## Problems with This Design:

- Every time a new shape is added (e.g., Triangle), you must modify the AreaCalculator class to accommodate it. This violates the Open/Closed Principle because the class is not closed for modification.
- The AreaCalculator class has to handle multiple shape types, making it complex and difficult to maintain.

## Applying OCP (Correct Design Using OCP)

To adhere to the Open/Closed Principle, you can use polymorphism. Each shape can have its own way of calculating its area, and the AreaCalculator doesn’t need to know the details of each shape.

### Step 1: Define a Common Interface for Shapes

```java
public interface Shape {
    double calculateArea();  // Open for extension: new shapes can implement this interface
}
```

### Step 2: Implement the Interface for Each Shape

```java
class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Modify the AreaCalculator to Use the Common Interface

```java
public class AreaCalculator {

    // Open for extension: New shapes can be added without changing this code
    public double calculateTotalArea(List<Shape> shapes) {
        double totalArea = 0;

        for (Shape shape : shapes) {
            totalArea += shape.calculateArea();
        }

        return totalArea;
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Add a New Shape (e.g., Triangle) without Modifying AreaCalculator

```java
class Triangle implements Shape {
    private double base;
    private double height;

    public Triangle(double base, double height) {
        this.base = base;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return 0.5 * base * height;
    }
}
```

Now, if you add a Triangle, the AreaCalculator class does not need to be modified. The new Triangle class implements the Shape interface and provides its own logic for calculating the area.

### Usage Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Shape> shapes = new ArrayList<>();
        shapes.add(new Rectangle(5, 10));
        shapes.add(new Circle(7));
        shapes.add(new Triangle(4, 8));  // Adding a new shape

        AreaCalculator calculator = new AreaCalculator();
        double totalArea = calculator.calculateTotalArea(shapes);

        System.out.println("Total Area: " + totalArea);
    }
}
```

## Benefits of OCP in This Example

- **Closed for Modification**: Once the AreaCalculator is written, it does not need to be modified if new shapes (like Triangle, Square, Ellipse) are introduced.
- **Open for Extension**: You can easily extend the system by adding new shapes that implement the Shape interface. These new shapes can have their own logic for calculating the area.
- **Easier to Maintain**: The AreaCalculator class is simplified, as it delegates the responsibility of calculating the area to each individual shape.
- **Reduced Risk of Bugs**: Since you don’t modify existing code (the AreaCalculator class), the risk of introducing new bugs is minimized.

# Summary

The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) ensures that classes are designed in a way that allows new functionality to be added without modifying existing code. In Java, you can achieve this using interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism. Following OCP helps in building flexible, maintainable, and scalable systems.
