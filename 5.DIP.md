The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is the fifth and final principle of the SOLID principles. It states:

    "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes)."

Additionally, it states:

    "Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."

In simpler terms, this principle emphasizes that:

1. High-level modules (those that contain complex logic and business rules) should not be tightly coupled to low-level modules (those responsible for handling detailed operations like data access, file handling, etc.).
1. Both high-level and low-level modules should depend on abstractions, such as interfaces or abstract classes, rather than on concrete implementations.
1. Abstractions should not depend on implementation details. The high-level module should use interfaces, and low-level modules should implement those interfaces.

## Why is DIP Important?

- It promotes loose coupling between different parts of a system.
- It makes the codebase more flexible and easier to extend or modify without affecting other parts of the system.
- It increases the testability of code, as we can easily mock dependencies using the interfaces.

Without DIP, high-level modules (which contain important business logic) can become tightly coupled to low-level modules (e.g., database handling, network communication). This makes it hard to change or replace low-level modules because doing so could require significant changes to the high-level logic as well.

## Breaking DIP: An Example Without DIP

Let’s consider a scenario where a high-level OrderService depends directly on a low-level MySQLDatabase class for storing order information.

```java
// Low-level module
class MySQLDatabase {
    public void saveOrder(String order) {
        System.out.println("Saving order to MySQL database: " + order);
    }
}

// High-level module
class OrderService {
    private MySQLDatabase database;

    public OrderService() {
        this.database = new MySQLDatabase();  // Tight coupling
    }

    public void placeOrder(String order) {
        database.saveOrder(order);
        System.out.println("Order placed: " + order);
    }
}
```

### Issues:

1. **Tight coupling**: The OrderService class is tightly coupled to the MySQLDatabase class. If we want to switch the database to another type (e.g., MongoDB), we need to modify the OrderService class.
1. **Reduced flexibility**: Any change in the low-level MySQLDatabase class might require a change in the high-level OrderService class.
1. **Difficult to test**: It becomes harder to mock or substitute the database in unit tests since OrderService is directly coupled to a specific database implementation.

## Applying DIP: Introducing Abstractions

To adhere to DIP, we need to introduce an abstraction (interface) that both the high-level OrderService and the low-level MySQLDatabase will depend on. This allows us to decouple the two modules and promote flexibility.

### Step 1: Create an Abstraction

We create an interface Database that defines a contract for saving an order. Both high-level and low-level modules will depend on this interface.

```java
// Abstraction (Interface)
interface Database {
    void saveOrder(String order);
}
```

### Step 2: Implement the Interface in Low-Level Modules

We create a class MySQLDatabase that implements the Database interface.

```java
// Low-level module (implements the interface)
class MySQLDatabase implements Database {
    @Override
    public void saveOrder(String order) {
        System.out.println("Saving order to MySQL database: " + order);
    }
}
```
Now, if we need another database, we can implement the same Database interface.

```java
// Another low-level module (implements the interface)
class MongoDBDatabase implements Database {
    @Override
    public void saveOrder(String order) {
        System.out.println("Saving order to MongoDB: " + order);
    }
}
```
### Step 3: Modify the High-Level Module to Depend on the Abstraction

The OrderService class no longer depends on a specific database implementation (like MySQLDatabase). Instead, it depends on the Database interface.

```java
// High-level module (depends on abstraction)
class OrderService {
    private Database database;

    // Dependency Injection via constructor
    public OrderService(Database database) {
        this.database = database;
    }

    public void placeOrder(String order) {
        database.saveOrder(order);
        System.out.println("Order placed: " + order);
    }
}
```
### Step 4: Inject Dependencies

Now we can inject different implementations of the Database interface into the OrderService, without changing the OrderService class itself.

```java
public class DIPExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Inject MySQL database
        Database mySQLDatabase = new MySQLDatabase();
        OrderService orderService1 = new OrderService(mySQLDatabase);
        orderService1.placeOrder("Order 1");

        // Inject MongoDB database
        Database mongoDBDatabase = new MongoDBDatabase();
        OrderService orderService2 = new OrderService(mongoDBDatabase);
        orderService2.placeOrder("Order 2");
    }
}
```
### Output:

```bash
Saving order to MySQL database: Order 1
Order placed: Order 1
Saving order to MongoDB: Order 2
Order placed: Order 2
```
## Key Points of Dependency Inversion:

1. **High-level modules depend on abstractions**: The OrderService no longer depends on concrete classes like MySQLDatabase but on an abstraction (Database interface).
1. **Low-level modules depend on abstractions**: The MySQLDatabase and MongoDBDatabase classes implement the Database interface.
- **No direct dependency on concrete implementations**: We can easily swap out one database implementation for another without modifying the high-level OrderService class.
- **Easier to extend**: New database types (e.g., PostgreSQLDatabase) can be added without modifying the existing high-level logic.
- **Improved testability**: Since OrderService depends on an interface, we can easily mock the Database interface during unit testing.

## Example with Dependency Injection

To further solidify the DIP concept, let’s introduce dependency injection. This is a design pattern that allows the high-level module to receive its dependencies (like the Database implementation) externally, rather than creating them internally. This can be achieved using frameworks like Spring, Guice, or manually through constructors or setters.
### Using Constructor Injection

```java
class OrderService {
    private final Database database;

    // Dependency Injection via constructor
    public OrderService(Database database) {
        this.database = database;
    }

    public void placeOrder(String order) {
        database.saveOrder(order);
        System.out.println("Order placed: " + order);
    }
}
```
In this example, the OrderService does not create its own dependencies (Database implementation). Instead, the dependency is passed to it via the constructor, making it easier to swap out the dependency or mock it in testing.

### Real-World Example: Logging Service

Let’s assume you have a high-level module that handles different operations, and you want to log those operations. You can apply DIP to abstract the logging mechanism, ensuring that the high-level module does not depend on a specific logging library or implementation.

```java
// Abstraction
interface Logger {
    void log(String message);
}

// Low-level module (implementation)
class FileLogger implements Logger {
    @Override
    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("Logging to file: " + message);
    }
}

// Another low-level module (implementation)
class DatabaseLogger implements Logger {
    @Override
    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("Logging to database: " + message);
    }
}

// High-level module (depends on abstraction)
class OrderProcessor {
    private Logger logger;

    public OrderProcessor(Logger logger) {
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    public void processOrder(String order) {
        logger.log("Processing order: " + order);
    }
}
```

## Summary of Dependency Inversion Principle:

- DIP promotes loose coupling by ensuring that high-level modules depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) rather than low-level concrete implementations.
- This allows for greater flexibility, making it easier to change, extend, and test code.
- DIP can be implemented using dependency injection to inject the necessary dependencies into classes.
