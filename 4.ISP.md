The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is the fourth of the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. It states:

    "Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use."

This principle encourages designing interfaces that are small, specific, and focused rather than large, generalized ones that force implementing classes to include unnecessary methods.

## Why Interface Segregation Matters

- **Avoids Fat Interfaces**: Large, generalized interfaces are known as fat interfaces. These interfaces often contain methods that many clients don’t need or use, which leads to bloated and harder-to-maintain code.
- **Improves Maintainability**: By breaking down large interfaces into smaller ones, it becomes easier to modify and maintain the code, as changes to one interface do not affect other unrelated classes.
- **Increases Flexibility**: Small interfaces allow developers to create more focused and reusable components, and implementing classes can be more specialized.
- **Encourages Separation of Concerns**: Each client only depends on what it needs, promoting a clean and understandable design.

## Key Concept: Fat Interfaces vs Segregated Interfaces

A fat interface is an interface with many methods that are not always relevant to all of its clients. Implementing classes are forced to provide definitions for methods they don't need, leading to unnecessary complexity.

On the other hand, segregated interfaces are interfaces that only contain methods relevant to a specific set of clients.

## Example Scenario: Without ISP (Fat Interface)

Consider an interface for a Printer. It defines various methods for different types of printing functionalities (normal printing, faxing, scanning, etc.).

```java
interface Printer {
    void printDocument(String document);
    void scanDocument(String document);
    void faxDocument(String document);
    void photocopyDocument(String document);
}
```

### Problem with Fat Interface

Let’s assume you have different kinds of printers:

- **BasicPrinter**: A simple printer that can only print documents.
- **AdvancedPrinter**: A multifunctional printer that can print, scan, fax, and photocopy.

A BasicPrinter is forced to implement all the methods, even though it only needs to print. This violates the Interface Segregation Principle.

```java
class BasicPrinter implements Printer {
    @Override
    public void printDocument(String document) {
        System.out.println("Printing: " + document);
    }

    @Override
    public void scanDocument(String document) {
        // Not supported
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Scan not supported");
    }

    @Override
    public void faxDocument(String document) {
        // Not supported
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Fax not supported");
    }

    @Override
    public void photocopyDocument(String document) {
        // Not supported
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Photocopy not supported");
    }
}
```

Here, BasicPrinter implements methods it doesn’t need, and it throws UnsupportedOperationException for methods it cannot support. This is inefficient and violates ISP.

## Applying ISP: Segregating the Interface

To follow ISP, we can split the Printer interface into smaller, more focused interfaces. This ensures that implementing classes only deal with the methods they need.

### Segregated Interfaces

```java
interface Print {
    void printDocument(String document);
}

interface Scan {
    void scanDocument(String document);
}

interface Fax {
    void faxDocument(String document);
}

interface Photocopy {
    void photocopyDocument(String document);
}
```

Now, the interfaces are segregated according to their functionality. This allows specific types of printers to implement only the functionality they support.

### Implementing Segregated Interfaces

```java
class BasicPrinter implements Print {
    @Override
    public void printDocument(String document) {
        System.out.println("Printing: " + document);
    }
}

class AdvancedPrinter implements Print, Scan, Fax, Photocopy {
    @Override
    public void printDocument(String document) {
        System.out.println("Printing: " + document);
    }

    @Override
    public void scanDocument(String document) {
        System.out.println("Scanning: " + document);
    }

    @Override
    public void faxDocument(String document) {
        System.out.println("Faxing: " + document);
    }

    @Override
    public void photocopyDocument(String document) {
        System.out.println("Photocopying: " + document);
    }
}
```

Now, BasicPrinter only implements the Print interface and is not forced to deal with scanning, faxing, or photocopying functionalities. AdvancedPrinter, on the other hand, implements all the necessary interfaces.

## Usage Example

```java
public class ISPTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Print basicPrinter = new BasicPrinter();
        basicPrinter.printDocument("ISP Example Document");

        AdvancedPrinter advancedPrinter = new AdvancedPrinter();
        advancedPrinter.printDocument("ISP Example Document");
        advancedPrinter.scanDocument("ISP Example Document");
        advancedPrinter.faxDocument("ISP Example Document");
        advancedPrinter.photocopyDocument("ISP Example Document");
    }
}
```

In this example, BasicPrinter and AdvancedPrinter each work with the interfaces they need, following the Interface Segregation Principle.

## Real-world Example: User Authentication

In real-world applications, large interfaces are often encountered in service or repository layers. Let’s consider a UserAuthenticationService that might contain a lot of responsibilities:

### Without ISP (Fat Interface)

```java
interface UserAuthenticationService {
    void registerUser(String username, String password);
    void loginUser(String username, String password);
    void logoutUser(String username);
    void resetPassword(String username);
    void verifyEmail(String username);
    void sendOTP(String username);
}
```

### Applying ISP: Segregated Interfaces

To follow ISP, we can break this down into smaller interfaces.

```java
interface UserRegistration {
    void registerUser(String username, String password);
}

interface UserLogin {
    void loginUser(String username, String password);
    void logoutUser(String username);
}

interface PasswordManagement {
    void resetPassword(String username);
}

interface EmailVerification {
    void verifyEmail(String username);
}

interface OTPService {
    void sendOTP(String username);
}
```

### Implementation

```java
class BasicAuthService implements UserLogin, UserRegistration {
    @Override
    public void registerUser(String username, String password) {
        System.out.println("User registered: " + username);
    }

    @Override
    public void loginUser(String username, String password) {
        System.out.println("User logged in: " + username);
    }

    @Override
    public void logoutUser(String username) {
        System.out.println("User logged out: " + username);
    }
}

class OTPAuthService implements OTPService {
    @Override
    public void sendOTP(String username) {
        System.out.println("OTP sent to: " + username);
    }
}

class EmailVerificationService implements EmailVerification {
    @Override
    public void verifyEmail(String username) {
        System.out.println("Email verified for: " + username);
    }
}
```

Each class now only implements the methods it actually needs, adhering to ISP.

## Benefits of ISP

- **Improved Code Maintainability**: Changes in one interface or class do not impact other unrelated classes.
- **Easier to Understand and Use**: Smaller interfaces are easier to comprehend, and clients can use only what they need.
- **Avoids Code Pollution**: By reducing the number of methods in an interface, implementing classes aren’t forced to include unnecessary code.
- **Testability**: Smaller, focused interfaces make it easier to test and mock objects during unit testing.

## Summary of Interface Segregation Principle:

- ISP encourages the use of small, specific interfaces rather than large, all-encompassing ones.
- Clients should not depend on methods they do not use, and each interface should have a specific role.
- By applying ISP, you create a clean, modular, and maintainable codebase where clients only interact with functionality they actually need.
